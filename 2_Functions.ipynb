You probably won't write your own for a little while. But there are higher order functions built into Python that you might find useful to call.\n","\n","Here's an interesting example using the max function.\n","\n","By default, max returns the largest of its arguments. But if we pass in a function using the optional key argument, it returns the argument x that maximizes key(x) (aka the 'argmax')."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sPHMl0jkpux-","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85},"outputId":"4b3b6315-dccb-4987-b34e-dff2255665b2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1563983081006,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":262,"user":{"displayName":"Minh Vo","photoUrl":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PsBBdGPNVOw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADA/CmfH3vaDIEk/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"14774517055753357846"}}},"source":["def mod_5(x):\n","    \"\"\"Return the remainder of x after dividing by 5\"\"\"\n","    return x % 5\n","\n","print(\n","    'Which number is biggest?',\n","    max(100, 51, 14),\n","    'Which number is the biggest modulo 5?',\n","    max(100, 51, 14, key=mod_5),\n","    sep='\\n',\n",")"],"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Which number is biggest?\n","100\n","Which number is the biggest modulo 5?\n","14\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
